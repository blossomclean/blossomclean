# Join Us

If you are reading this, let me first congratulate you that you have come to the right place for seeking work. We are always looking for sub-contractors to help our clients in their domestic needs. We have great clients giving you space and comfort to discharge your duties. As a business, we offer both cash payments or bank transfers to our prestigious clients. So, in effect, you may be getting paid directly by the client in the form of cash, from which, you will then need to bank transfer our commission or we will get the payment via bank transfer from which, we will be clearing your dues weekly or fortnightly.

If you have prior experience of domestic help, great! If not, letâ€™s not fret over it and we can create opportunities for you to get the necessary experience and gradually, you will start feeling confident on serving clients on your own. Every job is paid job with us and we respect your hard work and empathise with your life challenges. We are happy to onboard you, even if you give availability of one job a week and we will try to find a job for you near your home or workplace.

###Joining process

After on-boarding, we will assign you regular weekly, fortnightly etc. jobs as well as one-off/end of lease cleaning jobs based on your availability & suitability. Once we receive consent, we will share your details with our clients and introduce you. As we also serve NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) clients, you may also need to complete additional online trainings & documentation, if you opt to serve NDIS clients.

In order to make your efforts worthwhile, we offer a minimum of three hours booking to our clients and in some cases, with your consent (off-course) a minimum of two hours service, where a client is flexible and lives near to your other scheduled job.
