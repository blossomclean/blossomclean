Super confident about what it takes to get your bond money back but at the same time we would like you to be confident 
about asking the full refund of your hard-earned bond money from your real estate agent. 
To be completely transparent, we offer hourly cleaning service with the track record of so many end-of-lease cleanings where clients received they bond money back.

## How does it work?
Following the checklist provided by your property manager, you have two options to choose from:

###Option 1. Manage the tasks by yourself
   - Choose from the task list, whatever you would like to do it by yourself
   - Assign the tasks to the cleaner which you are not confident of doing by yourself
   - Give sign-off when the tasks are done, before the cleaner leaves the premise
   - This will be an hourly service in which all products and equipment will be provided by yourself

###Option 2. We manage the tasks for you
   - Provide us the real estate agent's checklist with some images giving us info about the condition of the property
   - We will estimate and share a quote with you that will include all products and equipment provided by us
   - Once the job is done, before we leave the premise, you need to give us the sign off that you are happy with the job done
