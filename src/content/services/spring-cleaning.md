##It's not a regular clean

- Fridge clean
- Oven clean
- Windows clean
- Cobweb removed
- Skirtings
- Detailed cleaning

## For the peace of mind
We charge by hours spent, not by effort needed, so book now for an **AUD 27.50 per hour** clean and offer a shiny clean home welcoming your family and friends.

Kindly note, this is not a regular clean, would be great if you can give us some advance notice beforehand so that we can arrange resources accordingly.
