For the peace of mind and priority service, book your housemaid for regular clean with the flexibility to choose from the tasks to be done

##How does it work?
- Let us know the location, preferred date & time, the frequency of work (daily, weekly, fortnightly etc.), scope of work (for e.g. how many bedrooms, bathrooms etc.)
- Based on this, we will assign you the best suited domestic help who is in the vicinity around that time and estimate hours needed to do the job
- Once booking is confirmed, we will send our team member for the first trial job (In this case, you can cancel the booking within first 30 minutes of the start)
- Trial job is an hourly charge service with the flexibility of cancellation within in the first 30 minutes, if the domestic help is not working as per your expectations
- After the first job, same domestic help would be assigned to serve you on regular basis
