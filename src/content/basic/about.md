My life as a common housewife, with two school going girls, was filled with plenty of time to utilise until my children came back from school and it was back to being a mom. Although, this ongoing cycle of tedious living gradually developed into a passion to explore and so, I decided to take casual teaching jobs. However, this soon led to chaos leaving the family clueless about what to do next. Frankly, this was not an ideal situation for the family and another idea was needed to best utilise my time while coming together as my job of being a wife and a mother. An idea, where I can enjoy flexible timing, can handle work-life balance better, and at the same time it is easy to start-up.

After careful consideration, it came to my notice that my struggle was common amongst other women. They wished for someone give them a hand for house-hold duties but at an affordable cost. Although, who will be available, who can give a hand, and at what cost? A few open questions and my journey started to find the answers to these questions began in the form of a start-up.

Gradually, I found a way into the cleaning/housekeeping industry. Why not I thought, this business reached out to whomsoever has time to spend and needed money. Be it overseas students, other housewives or anyone who desperately needs work. I felt that I was the connection between housewives needing a helping hand and cleaners needing jobs. My bonus was to know more about a few wonderful souls and create a difference in their livesâ€™ and at the same time, mine.

Over the last **3 years**, I have served more than **1000** clients with the help of more than **50** sub-contractors (few of them are still around). Since my business started in **November 2017**, this firm is consistently exceeding **200K** as annual revenue for the **last 2 years**, which is phenomenal considering Covid, and we are just entering into our growth phase.

Now, I would like to scale up the business and help other housewives who wants to do something like what I did and succeed. So, I engaged an IT company to build a platform where anyone can replicate my business model and achieve similar results without the hard work I went through and manage intricacies of operations. This platform will help in building a website per new business (I did everything from a Facebook page), connecting to a booking management, payments management and more.

Overall, the **mission** is to offer a platform to all who have time to spend and want money to earn either as providing cleaning/domestic help services by themselves or helping other clients/cleaners to connect.

Our longer term **vision** is to help every household around the world using our platform either as client, sub-contractor, or business manager.
