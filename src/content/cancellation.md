#CANCELLATION POLICY

##Objectives and Background
Blossom Clean is committed to providing the best service in a timely manner. We aim to accommodate your needs.
Unfortunately, when a client cancels without giving adequate notice, it prevents another client from being served. This cancellation policy is used as a way of respecting the time commitment of all involved. It explains the process for requesting a cancellation and the fees applicable. This policy is used in fairness to both our business and the clients who would otherwise have wanted an appointment.
We are implementing a straightforward cancellation policy to be upfront about all the costs you may face when engaging our services.
<br/>
<br/>
##Cancellation Process
We understand situations can arise in which you must cancel your appointment. Due to limited appointment availability, we request that you cancel with adequate notice. This allows us to fill that appointment slot.
You may cancel by contacting us by:
phone 0450138487; or email blossomclean101@gmail.com.
We require a minimum of 2 days notice for cancellation. Please inform us by 6 PM 2 days prior to your scheduled appointment to notify us of any changes or cancellations.
If no prior notice or the notice given is not provided within the minimum notice period, you will be charged a cancellation fee (see below) for the missed appointment.
<br/>
<br/>
##Late Arrivals
Late arrivals can only be extended to the remaining time of the scheduled appointment. If you are 30 minutes late past your appointment we will have to reschedule/cancel the appointment, which may incur cancellation fee.
<br/>
<br/>
##Cancellation Fee
The cancellation fee is $55.
The cancellation fee will be charged by bank transfer.
The cancellation fee may be deducted from any deposit paid for the appointment (if any).
The cancellation fee is the sole responsibility of the client and must be paid in full within 7 days after invoicing.
<br/>
<br/>
##Acceptable circumstances for waiving cancellation fees
We understand that plans may change due to uncontrollable and external circumstances. Missed appointments can be unintentional or may stem from an emergency, etc. Therefore, cancellation due to such circumstances will not incur a cancellation fee. Having cancellation fees waived require approval from Blossom Clean.
<br/>
<br/>
##Refund policy
If the notice of cancellation is given 2 days before the scheduled appointment, Blossom Clean will refund any deposit that was received to book an appointment.
<br/>
<br/>
